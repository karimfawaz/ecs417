        <h3>Personal Statement</h3>
        <article>
            Deciding that my future lied in Technology was never a discovery. From an early age, I enjoyed finding
            efficient
            solutions to everyday problems. On a personal scale, I tried to optimise the way I executed my daily tasks
            from
            a time and energy consumption standpoint. It was through trial and error that I had discovered the dopamine
            rush
            that came from failing numerous times before finally finding the best possible solution. Video games on
            mobile
            and console platforms were a prime source of entertainment during my childhood and teenage years. I enjoyed
            playing the games but did not understand how they worked. When I turned 15, I decided to build my own
            endless
            runner 2D game. It was through this project that I had discovered the difference between consuming the
            internet
            and actually using it to my advantage. I had used the Unity2D documentation pages and tutorials to start
            building 2D Arcade Games, using C Sharp. After building 12 Arcade Games and publishing two of them on the
            Google
            Play Store, I was fortunate enough to see the look on my family members’ faces while they were playing my
            games.
            This is how I had realised that I had a bigger project to build.
            In 2016, I won 1st place at the American University of Beirut's "Future Developer" robotics competition. It
            was
            during this boot camp that I had discovered that software development was not just about coding games.
            Mobile
            phones play a big role in today's society. Applications on these machines are truly powerful problem-solving
            tools. I had then decided to start my dream software development firm, Brain 2.0.
            Since then, I have developed 6 Android applications using Java and 2 using Kotlin. I have also created a few
            web
            scraping programs and a day of the week finder using Python. In 2018, I was elected by my school to
            participate
            in the Synkers StartUp Contest where I had tried to gamify the process of learning the basics of driving.
            This
            experience was insightful and taught me what it takes to run a successful start-up and made me grow my
            leadership abilities. In that year, I also had an internship at CME, a multinational technology firm, where
            I
            had worked with the Android, IOS, Telekom, and hardware teams for two weeks. I had a second two-week
            internship
            at CME in 2019, where I had worked with the Android Team. I was also elected to participate in the 2019 Math
            Olympics. During the summer of 2019, I have participated in the Lebanese American University Computer
            Science
            Summer Camp during which I had won second place in the final project competition and got me a scholarship. I
            have also participated in the Amazon Web Services July 2019 Conference.
            In 2020, during the lockdown, I have completed a 41-hour Udemy course to learn how to use Dart and the
            Flutter
            interface. I have used this interface to code many projects, including an appointment application for my
            local
            barber to help him during our country's worst economic crisis. I am currently developing an application to
            fight
            procrastination which uses a productivity timer, a revamped alarm to wake up and to go to bed earlier, and a
            task management system. I am also working on a web application to help students learn how to cook and make
            them
            aware of how much money they would save if they opt for the healthier options rather than consume unhealthy
            snacks or order take-out. I am also working on Brain 2.0’s web application to start expanding my dream
            company’s
            reach.
            I believe sports and team activities are great ways to bond with my colleagues and help eliminate stress.
            Being
            fluent in French, English, and Arabic should also help me expand my network. By the end of the 2020 - 2021
            academic year, I hope my knowledge in the software domain, along with my recent academic performance, would
            make
            me suitable for the Computer Science major as a second-year student in your prestigious institution, and I
            believe that the college experience at my dream university will help me further expand that knowledge.
