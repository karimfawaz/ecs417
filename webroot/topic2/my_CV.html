            Deciding that my future lied in Technology was never a discovery. From an early age, I enjoyed finding
            efficient solutions to everyday problems. On a personal scale, I tried to optimise the way I executed my
            daily tasks from a time and energy consumption standpoint. It was through trial and error that I had
            discovered the
            dopamine rush that came from failing numerous times before finally finding the best possible solution. Video
            games on
            mobile and console platforms were a prime source of entertainment during my childhood and teenage years. I
            enjoyed playing the games but did not understand how they worked. When I turned 15, I decided to build my
            own
            endless runner 2D game. It was through this project that I had discovered the difference between consuming
            the internet and actually using it to my advantage. I had used the Unity2D documentation pages and tutorials
            to
            start building 2D Arcade Games, using C Sharp. After building 12 Arcade Games and publishing two of them on
            the
            Google Play Store, I was fortunate enough to see the look on my family members’ faces while they were
            playing my games.
            This is how I had realised that I had a bigger project to build.
            In 2016, I won 1st place at the American University of Beirut's "Future Developer" robotics competition. It
            was during this boot camp that I had discovered that software development was not just about coding games.
            Mobile phones play a big role in today's society. Applications on these machines are truly powerful
            problem-solving tools. I had then decided to start my dream software development firm, Brain 2.0.
            Since then, I have developed 6 Android applications using Java and 2 using Kotlin. I have also created a few
            web scraping programs and a day of the week finder using Python. In 2018, I was elected by my school to
            participate in the Synkers StartUp Contest where I had tried to gamify the process of learning the basics of
            driving.
            This experience was insightful and taught me what it takes to run a successful start-up and made me grow my
            leadership abilities. In that year, I also had an internship at CME, a multinational technology firm, where
            I had worked with the Android, IOS, Telekom, and hardware teams for two weeks. I had a second two-week
            internship at CME in 2019, where I had worked with the Android Team. I was also elected to participate in
            the 2019 Math
            Olympics. During the summer of 2019, I have participated in the Lebanese American University Computer
            Science Summer Camp during which I had won second place in the final project competition and got me a
            scholarship. I
            have also participated in the Amazon Web Services July 2019 Conference.
            In 2020, during the lockdown, I have completed a 41-hour Udemy course to learn how to use Dart and the
            Flutter interface. I have used this interface to code many projects, including an appointment application
            for my
            local barber to help him during our country's worst economic crisis. I am currently developing an
            application to
            fight procrastination which uses a productivity timer, a revamped alarm to wake up and to go to bed earlier,
            and a
            task management system. I am also working on a web application to help students learn how to cook and make
            them aware of how much money they would save if they opt for the healthier options rather than consume
            unhealthy
            snacks or order take-out. I am also working on Brain 2.0’s web application to start expanding my dream
            company’s reach.
            I believe sports and team activities are great ways to bond with my colleagues and help eliminate stress.
            Being fluent in French, English, and Arabic should also help me expand my network.
